The underlying principle of microbox cross-sandboxing is that one Microbox Codeblock using another codeblock (perhaps by another author) must be *perfectly* equivalent to that code included directly and is ONLY a performance benefit by deduplicating shared code!!

This also is *another* reason there can be no reflection in Microbox Environments.
