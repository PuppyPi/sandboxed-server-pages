==Microbox==
• Pixelverse
• ManyMath/Code/Test!
• ManySite! (!!! :DDD )
• Inter-process Computation!
	+ like sending a tiny piece of code, such as an SQL query, between completely separate Unix processes..that might not even be written in the same primary language!!
• Various Database Clustering and Load Balancing of Computation!! :DD
	+ eg, sending code that produces data and re-running it on different datacenters around the world if that would be faster than actually sending its output! XD


==Macrobox==
• MacrOS! 8>>!
	+ Honestly, this should probably just use its own system since how inter-program API calls work while something is being saved/loaded is, of course, heavily dependent on the platform (and I only had MacrOS/RC3/ConnexOS/etc. in mind when designing this XD'' )

• Pausable things like game engine agents with uncooperative multitasking (eg, C3/DS)
	+ These could just be done by making the CAOS or Coroutine Lua/Python or other script compile into a Microbox function which returns another thing to call to run the next bit of the code :33 since it's reasonable for them to statically know in advance how much code to run per tick in non-INST blocks!

• BOINC!
	+ Should probably use WebAssembly, honestly X'D
