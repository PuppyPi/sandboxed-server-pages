• There are no (mutable) static variables and there is no (mutable) static state!!
	• An analogous system can be made by providing *every function other than Main()* with an instance of a GIANT STRUCT, which includes a field for *every static field of every class in the source code!!!* XD
		And then the Main() function instantiates a new instance of this and passes it to the other functions it calls, which then pass it along to others! :3
		And dispatchable object instances that can be passed out into the world beyond our module and then back in must also include a field for this giant struct..which they always could do for "internal state"! :3
		• I *think* this only doesn't work in situations that it *shouldn't* work lest the entire design goals of Microbox be violated! XD


• A Microbox Code Module is this:
	• Microbox Version
	• Dispatchable Declarations
	• Functions
	• Number of External Function Declarations (no actual declaration is provided; instead, it's checked at link time against every call-site!  Which *should*'ve been done anyway in self-consistency verification, so this is no extra work!!)
	• Number of External Leaf Datatypes (no actual declaration is provided to allow for maximum forwards-compatibility!)
	• Number of External Generic Base Datatypes (no actual declaration is provided to allow for maximum forwards-compatibility!)
	• Constant Data (to be computed!! which allows any datatypes to be used for literals, with only byte[] as the fundamental literal!)
		• Simply composed of a reference to a Function which takes no input!
	
	• Pools: Conceptually absent but present in bytecode for conciseness with variable-length things!  Including the Constant Pool!
		• Immutable Byte String Literals
		• Compound Datatypes
			• Generics-Applied Things
			• Base Datatypes
			• Structs/Tuples
		• Dispatchee Definitions
			Composed of:
			• An optional struct/tuple
			• A nonempty rimap of Dispatchable Declarations to Functions!
				!!• ONLY TO OUR INTERNAL FUNCTIONS FOR EASE OF SECURITY/SANDBOXING


• Microbox Code Modules can be linked in the following way!
	• Dispatchable Declarations which are Exactly Equivalent being linked as being The Same Thing.  Ie, when B is loaded, the equivalent mapping is provided to A and then those Dispatchable Declarations in B are the same as in A!  And objects passed between them work like you'd expect! :D
	• Satisfying External Function Declarations with Functions from another Module!!
		• These are also to be satisfied by the Container!


• Fundamental datatypes provided by the Standard Library but required by the code format itself are:
	• Boolean (whatever type matches the inputs to loops and branches!)
	• Immutable Byte String (index into the constant pool or Immediate)
	• Unit/Void Datatype (the datatype of input to inputless functions and output to outputless functions)
	• Reified Function (whether internal or external!; index into itself or the External Function Declarations bank!)
	• Reified Datatype (index into itself!)
		• Function (Compound) Datatypes
		• Genericized (Compound) Datatypes


• Things provided by Runtime Libraries are:
	• Dispatching!!
		• Dispatch Lookup: takes a Dispatchable Declaration object as input and outputs an Alternation Type of the Function object or the Unmapped singleton!
	• Arithmetic
	• Boolean Algebra
	• Data/Bytes/Buffers/Memory/Arrays access

• Things (DANGEROUSLY) provided by Container Libraries are:
	• Advanced Garbage Collection things (Namely Collection Listeners and Weak References!)
	• I/O / Environment
	• Nested Container API  (so microboxen can have *their own microbox containers!!*)
	• Concurrency/Parallelism/Threading!!

• Things commonly provided by either other Microbox code that is to be linked, or by Container Libraries so that the external functions are using the same datatypes and such!


• Code is provided in Structured Form with Single-Static Assignment
	+ There are no declarations of datatypes for local variables; instead, analysis is simply performed on the (sole) output that produces it and all inputs that use it!
	
	Statements are:
		• Pack/Unpack Struct/Tuple
			!!!!• NOTE THAT STRUCTS/TUPLES CAN ONLY BE UNPACKED BY THE SAME MICROBOX MODULE THAT PACKED THEM!!!!!   This is usually implemented by every Tuple used by a Microbox Module producing its own Java Class / Runtime Type with the fields named eg, f0, f1, f2, etc.!!  Across modules and the module-container API boundary, tuples are completely opaque and only Dispatching can be done with them!!!
			• Outputs can be bound to variables (*defining the variable!*) or Not Unpacked, This thus also doubles as Variable Assignment!
			• *VERY often paired with Function Invocation!!*
			!!• Pack has two forms: Dispatchable and Undispatchable!  If Dispatchable, a Dispatchee Definition must be provided (that is, an index into our Dispatchee Definitions Pool in the bytecode X3 ), otherwise a normal Struct/Tuple (also an index into the Pool) must be provided!
				+ There is no "create blank mutable struct"; initial values must always be explicitly provided for robustness and security and determinism!! :3
		• Function Invocation (*no* lowlevel varargs!! for security!)
			• The inputs are packed directly, not through Pack Struct!
			• The function to invoke is a Normal Input!  And the function object is provided as a literal for Static Invocation and a local-variable-or-parameter for 
		• Function Partial Application (but allowing any parameters to be bound, not just the first N!)
			• The single output similarly to Function Invocation can be bound to a variable or not!
		• Lookup Dispatchable
			• Takes as input the (hopefully!) dispatchable object and returns either a Function object or the special Microbox UndispatchableFunction value.
	
	Fundamental Control Flows are:
		• If/Else Boolean
		• Match Alternation Type
			+ Like If/Else but matches every possible Case for an internally-defined Alternation Type! :D
		• (Infinite) Loop
			• Break
			• Continue
		• Return
	
	Syntactic Sugar constructs can include:
		• Switch case
		• For Loops
		• While Loops
		• For Each Loops


• Functions take a fixed number of zero or more inputs with datatypes provided and output a fixed number of zero or more outputs with datatypes also provided.
	There are no byref or "output parameters" for security, just utilize the ability to have multiple outputs!




• Datatypes (semantics and operations largely defined by Standard Libraries)
	• Leaf Types:
		• Defined by the platform except for boolean (always #0), these take no further type parameters!  (Eg, u32, s64, uuid, enums, etc.)
	• Function Signatures:
		• These take a single Datatype as their input and a single datatype as their output, normally both of which will be Structs!
			• So basically it's a 2-tuple XD except that any two function signatures across all of microbox that are the same are the same!  Unlike Structs/Tuples, for which ones you'd think were the same are actually tagged with Which Module Defined Them and are Incompatible Types if defined in different modules!!
	• Generic/Product/Struct/Tuple Types:
		• These start with a Container-Defined Generic Base Type or a Generic Struct and apply a tuple of other Datatypes to it
			• Generic Structs are defined here and are effectively like Tuples in Haskell
				• There is also the notion of Completely Generic Structs 
	• (Concrete) Structs/Tuples
		• All Struct Definitions (concrete or generic) are combined in the identifier with an Mutable or Immutable flag!  So there is no need to define it twice!
		+ The name "struct" is meant to confer the perception that this is the Internal Implementation-Defined Memory Layout, and as such is never exposed in Linking across Microbox Modules or Linking with the Container!
	• Sum/Alternation/Algebraic/Union Types:
		• These are Tagged Unions like in Rust or Haskell and could be implemented extremely performantly!  Which is important for the Output Data Definition of functions that allow for Success-or-Error alternates with effectively completely different output arities!!




• Design requirements!!
	
	• INTENSE SANDBOXING OF COURSE
		This is the reason why
		• INTERNAL MEMORY LAYOUTS DEFINED IN ONE MODULE ***OR ESPECIALLY THE CONTAINER*** ARE INACCESSIBLE BY ANOTHER; UNPACK-STRUCT OR GET-UNION-CASE ONLY WORKS FOR STRUCTS PACKED BY THE SAME MODULE
			• Inter-Module Interaction or Module-Container Interaction is only to be done through Dispatching (Object-Orientation) or by static functions (eg, to pass an opaque pointer you got from one module back to another function in the same module!)
			• This means that, while, say, a struct{u32,u32,byte[]} is the same as any other struct{u32,u32,byte[]} within the SAME module, these are completely different datatypes if defined in separate modules!!!
				• This doesn't apply to the "struct/tuples" and "alternations/unions" in function signatures!!  Because an actual Pack/Unpack Struct instruction isn't used on them!
		• Dispatchee Definitions are not reified objects like Dispatchable Declarations and can't be passed around to other modules!
		• Dispatchee Definitions cannot map to External Functions, only to internal ones!  If you really need that, a stub function that does nothing but call another function is plenty easy enough to implement and easy for platform implementations to compile away, being a static function invocation and all X33
			This is because it might be easy for platform implementations to forget to perform the same safety/consistency/sandboxing/etc. checks they normally would if *actual external functions* are used!!
		!!!!• CONTAINERS SHOULD BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT RUNTIME LIBRARY FUNCTIONS THEY PROVIDE TO ALLOW INTROSPECTING INTO FUNCTIONS OR DISPATCHABLE DECLARATIONS!!!  Since this is the only way for Microbox Code to look inside some other Microbox Module than its own outside of explicitly allowing that for Admin Modules that are given a special interface!
	
	• No security violations possible with microbox code linking to other microbox code!!
		• This is only fundamentally guaranteed if both microbox codes have exactly the same Container Libraries available to them!!
			And different capabilities for different code is exclusively managed by instance objects provided to main() or other entrypoint functions called by the container!  Ie, Capability-Based Security!!
		• No Static Mutable Data is required for this, otherwise it would be mathematically possible for A and B to share data otherwise impossible if they both call functions in C (which could store object instances from A or from B in its static variables, then hand them back out to B or A!!!)
	
	• Determinism!!  Though that heavily relies on the Runtime/Container libraries supporting this too, and they might have no interest in supporting that XD   But Microbox *itself* should support that!!
		• The reason for this is so that (if the Container supports Perfect Determinism) the same microbox Function being called will *always* produce the same output for the same input!!  Like a functional language *from the external worlds point of view* while allowing either imperative (or ofc by extension functional) internal code!!
			+ This is used for database clustering (eg, servers on different continents reliably producing the same Derived Data to be cached without having to send it over the network!), load balancing of server-side rendering and similar things (the same code produces the same results on any server!), code migration/transfer (eg, microbox being used instead of SQL allows for the query to be sent to an unspecified machine/process with the same data in the database replicated cluster and will produce the same output as a Query Predicate for example!! :DD ), client-server replication (to avoid things having to be sent over a network, like with database clustering replication but for lossy transfer that can rewind and recalculate things on recovering from a network hiccup, like for physics trajectories of sprites/objects in online video games!)  :DD
		• This also requires No Static Mutable Data!!
		• This is also why floats are generally absent, and fixed-point arithmetic and rounding modes and unicode and such things are implemented *within microbox* as heavily-linked-to modules so that they will be carried across networks naturally along with all the other Module Dependencies of a Database Query Module or etc.! :DD
	
	• Quotas!!
		• Code size, of course, easy peasy X3   Enforced at Load Time
		• Memory usage
		• CPU usage
		• Container-Defined Quotas (eg, Network Bandwidth X3 )
