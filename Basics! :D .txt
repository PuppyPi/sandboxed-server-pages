	Either way, it's SSP! XD



SSP is a definition of an (extremely simple) Manage Runtime Environment, like the JVM (not Java) or the .NET CLR (not C#).
There can be many (mostly equivalent) languages that parse to its core format (an Abstract Syntax Tree object graph, not bytecode like the JVM or CLR, but it's equivalent)  This defines the semantics of how it actually runs and interacts with its environment, what its standard library is, and its data types.

The defining feature of SSP is that it's meant so that you can run (simple but turing-complete) untrusted code on a sensitive system, and run it very fast!  Not that you'll necessarily use it for that, but if it's *designed* for the maximum level of security/reliability, then it'll work for all other levels :)
(eg, to prevent trusted code from letting a hacker in! or just to enforce code audits and reliability to avoid unexpected behavior from features being enabled you didn't even know were enabled (*cough* JSP accessing any method starting with "get" or "is" as a property *cough* XD) )

Not only is the communication with the outside very locked-down (no communication is possible except one giant block of input at the start and a giant block of output at the end), but there are also memory quotas and processing/CPU quotas to avoid infinite loops and recursions (which are measured in (approximate) number-of-operations not wall time, so if a server bogs down from something, it won't cause unrelated pages/programs to randomly fail!  if it passes once, the same input will make it pass again *no matter what*)
**SSPrograms are 100% deterministic!** (this is important for caching their output)
(*note that implementations which break the sandboxing and allow custom extensions may not be 100% deterministic, but Proper SSP Implementations are.)




Data types!:
	• Null (no Undefined though dffldkjfdlkj XD )
	• Boolean
	
	• Number
		• Integer (infinite precision, but usually efficient impl)
		• Rational (infinite precision, but usually efficient impl)
		• Float (64-bit double-precision)
	
	• Node
		+ The only immutable thing that has (reference) "identity"
	
	• List
		• Mutable (and Variable-Length) or Immutable
		• Element Type:
			• Default Lists are polymorphic (any contents)
			• Subtype: Unicode String (elements are UInt32's)
				+ Note that this can be mutable (and thus variable-length!) too!  In which case it's like a StringBuilder in Java.
			• Subtype: Byte Array (elements are UInt8's)
				+ Note that this can be mutable (and thus variable-length!) too!
	
	• Set
		+ Immutable things work like you expect, according to their data (immutable things have no reference identity except for Node)
		+ Mutable things do NOT work according to their contents but always to their (reference) identity.  This is required in a programming language to prevent hashmaps and hashsets from becoming corrupted!!  ([cough] yeah, *Java* [cough])
		• Mutable (ofc Variable-Size) or Immutable
		+ Elements can be absolutely anything!
	
	• Map
		+ Keys work same as Sets
		• Mutable (Variable-Keyset) or Immutable
		+ Both keys and values can be absolutely anything!
	
	+ Note that while mutable Lists/Sets/Maps *created by SSP code* are always fully modifiable and variable-size, not all instances are, since you can get views of some that aren't (eg, a map's keyset is mutable if the underlying map is, but you can't modify it *by modifying the key set* only by modifying the map!)
	
	
	• Struct (Custom Datatype)
		• Mutable (ofc Variable-Size) or Immutable
		+ Can be defined within SSP or by the container for communication with SSP!
		+ Can inherit from another struct type!  And then you can use that struct type to access those fields of this one!  :D
		+ By convention, field names aren't allowed to be integers in ascii base 10, and those that are, are special things (eg, for the Type special field for someone building object orientation on top of SSP! :3 )
	
	
	+ Static typing is optional but improves performance
		If static typing is not used, core operations will fail if the type is wrong, but struct field accesses will be converted into the (*massively slower*) LookupGet and LookupSet operations!
		Static typing includes (only) the "?" modifier which allows null for that type (eg, SSP "boolean" is like Java "boolean", and SSP "boolean?" is like Java "Boolean"  :3 )
		And static typing ofc can specify mutable-only, immutable-only, or either as well!  (it's up to the syntax/parser how it does that though X3 )




Control flow and operations!:
	• Branches: If/ElseIf/Elif/Else or SwitchCase/SelectCase/ChooseWhen
		• All others are syntactic sugar for a simple if/else
	
	• Loops
		• ForEach (over a list, set, map's keys, or struct's values)
		• ForEachPair (over a map's keys and values simultaneously)
		• Repeat (a traditional for loop with a counter that starts at one point and goes a certain number of iterations)
		• While/Until (all others are syntactic sugar for while loops)
	
	• Note: there is no break or continue in loops; just use boolean variables and if/else/elseif (it would be confusing otherwise what happened to HTML in between, since it is a templating language after all! XD )
		+ This can also easily enable some interesting code transpilations and optimizations since SSP is Perfectly Structured Code :>
	
	• Call SSP taglib (eg, like calling a procedure)
		• SSP taglib tags have no "return value" per se, but they do have zero, one, or more output variables which, upon it returning to the caller, set variables in its scope (just like "a, b = f(x)" in Python or Lua)  :3
	
	• Call SSP-defined function (just equivalent to calling a taglib tag which has only one output variable which is used as the "return value")
		+ May be compiled into an actual Java/etc. function though for performance! (only if any taglib with only one byref variable would be converted to that!)
	
	• Dynamically call SSP-defined taglib/procedure/function (it's all the same thing)!
		+ This allows functional programming (and possibly rudimentary OOP as syntactic sugar!)  :>
	
	• Operations!
		• Output (this is the implicit operation by just having text lying around since it is a templating language after all XD unless Headless is specified for the source code file)
			+ This is not represented in the abstract syntax tree, instead, there is simply a Mutable String variable named "__output__" provided as an input variable and this operation (if ever present) is simply converted by the parser, or is present in an SSP-defined standard library file as just append()ing to that variable
				+ This way, if the SSP core is ever used for..not server pages, there won't be a strange output() function in contexts that would be confusing XD (like public sites allowing random people to upload little bits of pure mathematics code or a site allowing complex configuration code or etc. untrusted code that needs to be both fast and secure :> )
		
		• Output Escaped
			+ Just like output() above but escapes the output (eg, so if you use ${person.email} and it's like "Foo Bar <foo.bar@gmail.com>" then it won't actually output that haha, it'll output "Foo Bar &lt;foo.bar@gmail.com&gt;" when SSP is used for generating HTML (as opposed to, say, CSS!))
			+ Again, this isn't actually part of the core runtime / language at all; it's added by parsers and standard libraries (eg, so that different escaping can be used for HTML, CSS, Generated Source Code, and nothing at all where output() and outputEscaped() don't exist, like for using this for any untrusted logic on a server with a more normal code syntax!)
		
		• Fail
			Explicit page failure (this is just "throw" in Java)
			(there is no try/catch, since recoverable/signal-type failures don't happen often in web templating languages XD )
			This causes a 500 Internal Server error response (or tries to; see below) and triggers the error monitoring logic defined by the outside code, so it's not to be used lightly!
			+ Represented in the abstract syntax tree as a procedure (no return value) taking a single UnicodeString input
			+ There is a procedure one (like a tag) and one that appears to be a function with a return value but which actually just fails the program and never returns XD
		
		• Set a local variable
			• Including to a literal, including a static Callable (Function/Procedure/TaglibTag/etc. :> )
		
		• Variables and Structs
			• Get/Set
				+ "gets/sets" (for structs) on untyped variables are converted to LookupGet/LookupSet for structs by the SSP parser.
				• Set is not allowed on immutable structs (which is known at compile time since these are Get/Set not LookupGet/LookupSet!)
			• LookupGet/LookupSet a field from a struct dynamically, given a string input as the field name!; these are represented as normal functions/procedures in the abstract syntax tree (because they are!); these are also MUCH slower than Get/Set!!!
				• any LookupGet(struct obj, String fieldName)
				• void LookupSet(struct obj, String fieldName, any newValue)
		
		• Conditionally evaluating things
			• Short-circuiting boolean AND and OR (also variadic!) just like Java or most languages (except they're variadic)
			
			• Conditional Expression (Java "a ? b : c" and Python "b if a else c")
				Only evaluates the part that gets returned! (eg, in case one part contains fail() !! )
		
		• Partial Function Application
			+ Given a function/procedure, you can arbitrarily (not just the first N, but any) provide values to fix the inputs at, removing them from the final function/procedure, and discard outputs, removing them from the final function/procedure, to create a new function/procedure!  To be invoked with dynamic invocation.
		
		
		• NO REFLECTION OR DIGGING INSIDE THINGS X'D
			The whole point is to be secure!!  That always ends badly when they can dig inside some platform thing they're not supposed to! X'D
			If you want this, build it on top with an intermediate layer that stores the data every time something is done (eg, a rewriter layer that takes all SSP code and rewrites it so that Partial Function Application stores metadata into the callable objects it creates)
			• The sole exceptions to this are these (to go along with dynamic dynamic function invocation XD')
				• Get number and data types of inputs and outputs
				• Get name of function as unicode string (you could see this anyway with its toString() ofc XD )
				• Dynamically call a function/procedure, not just dynamically like "which thing is called" is dynamic, but like, the inputs and outputs and their types aren't hardcoded!  They're just normal Lists!  This is slower than normal dynamic function invocation (which is, itself, a little slower than static function invocation..but not thaaat much slower.  This is *really* slow!   ..Unless it's JIT optimized of course XD'' )
				• See all the field names in a struct (this is already used in its definition of equality/hashcode/comparison where it's treated like a map of strings to values)
		
		
		• Data Operations (Built-in Compiler Functions/Procedures)
			+ So numerous they're defined in another documentation file XD




How to build things on top of SSP :3
	• Object-Orientation
		Just make every object be a struct that inherits from the One Very Important Struct which has one field that is a reference to a Map that is the struct's Runtime Type! :D
		And then you can do lookups of methods by name or something in that Map to find the implementations, and then use simple Dynamic Function Invocation to call them! :D
	
	• Exceptions
		Just make everything that can possibly throw an exception output a special output alongside the others, and have everything that calls it check if that output is null, and if not, "throw" what it returns (by returning it on their special output, and arbitrary undefined data on their others).
	
	• Lambdas/Closures
		Define a new Function/Procedure and then use Partial Function Application on it! :D



How to build things in SSP within SSP o,o
	+ Maybe I should shrink the standard truly-core definition even further? XD''
	• Maps
		Just structs with references to a list it uses as the hashtable!  With a boolean list (which has a compact representation in the builtin core) as the "is it overloaded?" flag that tells if it's actually a list to naive-search through!
	• Sets
		Done however maps are done but with no values X3
	• Nodes
		Just empty mutable structs! XD
	• How to make this all work with the standard library functions!
		Well you need to *implement* the standard library functions and check for all these special things! XD
		Using the truly-builtin functions!  (That are what's actually security-audited and heavily scrutinized! :3 )



Directives:
	• Use active-memory-usage (a WeakSet of all objects) for the memory quota not total-accumulated-allocations (with just a counter) to reduce quota-exceeded exceptions but at the expense of performance
		+ Applies to the entire page/program (can be defined in taglib files but if the outermost page defines it, its setting takes priority (so that way a library file that does lots of allocations and deallocations can set this for the convenience of web page designers using it :3))
		+ Toplevel page files can set this to either Allocations or True-Usage but taglib (library) files can only set it to True-Usage so that a confusing situation where two library files explicitly set it to opposite values doesn't happen)
			+ So unless the toplevel page sets it to Allocations explicitly, At Least One library file setting it to True-Usage causes the whole program to be True-Usage.
		+ The default is Allocations.
	
	• Headless: do not output anything; this is a code/logic-only file! (eg, a taglib function just as normal code (eg, a date formatter))
		+ Applies to the file it is defined in.




Communication with the outside:
	
	• SSP *cannot ever call outside code* (in the secure, locked-down implementations (engines) )
		+ This is not meant to operate on a threat model where the outside code is untrusted, but to avoid the (possibly) untrusted SSP code *accidentally* calling outside code!!  (JSP for example, can call code the author of the code may have had no idea it could call just through ${} expressions!)
		+ This can be overridden for some SSP implementations that aren't meant to run untrusted code (but are just for people who really like SSP ://3 )
			+ For example, allowing the outside code to provide variables with "lazy values", which are nullary lambdas that are either used and called *once* and the value cached, or are not used and called zero times.  SSP cannot distinguish between these and normal (eager) values provided to it.  (This allows for entire database queries to not be done if they're unnecessary)
			+ And custom tags
			+ This should probably only be done in ways that are very explicit!  Unlike JSP which allows ridiculous amounts of access to Java code that the coders may have never intended to be accessed by JSP! XD  (and thus, security aside, they might refactor-rename and update all Java invocations, but *no IDE can possibly* update the uses of it in JSP since JSP is dynamically-typed!!  The same is true for fields in SSP, but those are annotated with @SSPField and so it is explicit.)
				+ But you could have @SSPGetter and @SSPSetter to explicitly mark them :3
			+ It's invisible to SSP though!  The SSP language doesn't need to be affected; just functions and procedures provided that appear equivalent to custom ones written in SSP :>    (no "EL extensions" like in JSP dlksjdflkjf that totally screws up *field* and *array* access which should be insanely fast! X'D   and no custom control flow things!! if's and while loops in SSP should be if's and while loops in Java!! sdlkjslksjf XD )
			+ And have either a *whole separate git branch of the SSP engine* or a boolean parameter during instantiation of the SSP engine that can't ever be changed as to whether these features are on or off (or better, two functions "newLockedInstance()" or "newUnlockedInstance()" for maximum clarity in security audits! :3 )
	• All communication occurs at the beginning and end of the program through variables and the text output
		• Input Variables are set by the outside logic (eg, like how Java EE code sets variables for JSP), and often involve custom structs
		• Output Variables are set by the SSP page/program and read by the outside
		+ java.util.Lists and Sets and Maps are even copied in case their runtime class is not normal (like ArrayList or LinkedList or etc.)
	• Structs can be defined outside SSP and (in the Java implementation at least) annotations make this easy
		+ External structs' accesses are done purely through fields, not methods like getters!  So SSP can't ever call outside code.
		+ The Java classes that correspond to the structs can have methods! it's just that SSP won't call them; it will only get and set public fields.
		+ If a definition of the struct datatype is given that conflicts with the name of the externally-defined one, it must be a subset (or equal to) the externally-defined one's fields.
		+ External structs can be either mutable or immutable but immutable ones cannot be created by SSP!  (even if the struct is redefined within SSP.  I mean if it's not intended to be the same thing as the externally-defined one, then you'll run into field conflicts anyway probably!)
	• Note that an externally-defined struct class that is defined as mutable (with all exposed public fields as mutable, not "final" in Java) can still be considered to be immutable in SSP (it will just use an internal wrapper class then unwrap it if it's sent to an Output Variable :3 ), and SSP will use its own definition of equals and hashCode for them (like it does for mutable structs too).
	
	• SSP sets, keys for maps, equals, and hashCode are
		• a) specifically defined and might not match the outside language (eg, Java considers mutable datastructures to have hashCode/equals() the same as immutable ones @,@ )
		• b) will use its own internal code for it and not ever call equals()/hashCode() on an externally-defined struct class! (remember, SSP Does Not Call Outside Code! that's the price you pay for enough security to *let strangers run random code on your possibly-critical webserver!! @,@*  XD' )









Performance:
	SSP is always run by being transpiled into the surrounding programming language (eg, Java) then dynamically compiled and loaded into memory :>>
	(ideally the surrounding language gets then further compiled to machine code through JIT for bleeding-edge performance! :D )



Dealing with resource quotas:
	• Processing Quota
		• Loop Quota
			Every loop has an increment/check at the end of it and, whether it's an inner loop, outer loop, loop in a taglib tag, loop in a taglib tag invoked by itself recursively! or etc., it all increments the loop counter for the entire page/program!
			If this check fails (loop counter > quota maximum) then the page/program fails.
	
		• Invocation Quota
			The first or second line in any transpiled function is a increment/check for invocation quota.
			Whether it's a function, procedure, invoked-by-toplevel, invoked-by-library, invoked-by-*itself!* (recursion), there is one giant counter for "how many function calls" were performed.
			If this check fails (invocation counter > quota maximum) then the page/program fails.
	
	
	• Memory Quota
		• Recursion Depth (Stack) Quota
			The second or first line in any transpiled function is a increment/check for recursion depth.
			The underlying programming language will probably have some quota of its own (StackOverflowError), but this allows it to be set to much less for SSP pages :3
		
		• Object Graph (Heap) Quota
			The SSP engine tracks the objects allocated by the SSP page/program (though not the ones given by the outside code) and keeps a tally so that new allocations increment/check and may fail.
			However, the default way (a monotonically increasing counter) is extremely fast but inaccurate because it doesn't track de-allocations (from garbage collection), and so there is a directive for a page to switch itself to a much slower technique based on weak-references (a la java.util.WeakHashMap, but not that; more like WeakArrayList XD)
	
	
	
	• Page/Program Failure
		Just like any web thing, this tries to send HTTP 500 Server Error (withOUT SENDING SERVER DETAILS TO THE RANDOM UNTRUSTED INTERNET PERSON LKDSJfdlkfjdlfkdjfl), but if the HTTP status code has already been sent then this is impossible!  So it does its best and appends something like "<h1>SSP Streaming Dynamic Page Error<br>HTTP 500 Internal Server Error</h1>" (the exact string is configurable (per page or for groups) by the outside).
		It also calls a callback given to the engine by the outside so it can send someone an email, store it in a database, log it to a log file, whatever :3
