# sandboxed-server-pages
A webpage templating language (a la JSP/ASP/PHP) that is so locked-down and sandboxed as to make it feasible securitywise to run untrusted web templates on a server! (eg, for (super)themes)  And (implementations can be) fast enough at runtime for extensions to feasibly be done *in* the language, with no capacity for other language extension (for security).
